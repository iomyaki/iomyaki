| üåê | **[FastAPI Blog](https://github.com/iomyaki/fastapi-blog)** | FastAPI blog with web interface, basic authentication and connection to Postgres database | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Alembic, Jinja2, PostgreSQL |
| üê≤ | **[D&D Assistant](https://github.com/iomyaki/build-n-roll-tg-bot)** | A team project from hackathon: a Telegram bot that generates *Dungeons & Dragons* characters with effective stats, backstory, and portrait | asyncio, aiogram, numpy, requests, SQLite |
| ü§ñ | **[Bot for Paid Subscriptions](https://github.com/iomyaki/paid-sub-tg-bot)** | This Telegram bot allows you to implement paid subscriptions to a private channel. The bot tracks subscriptions, sends reminders about their expiration and removes participants whose subscriptions have expired | asyncio, aiogram, SQLite, AsyncIOScheduler |
| üîÆ | **[AstroBot](https://github.com/iomyaki/astro-tg-bot)** | A test task from hh: a Telegram bot for generating horoscopes. Practice on the intricacies of creating bots | asyncio, aiogram, SQLite, AsyncIOScheduler |
| üéÆ | **[Games](https://github.com/iomyaki/games)** | In my free time, I write simple games: an unbeatable tic-tac-toe, a hard "Battleship" game, Russian lotto simulation, Conway's Game of Life. I develop without guides, coming up with the mechanics implementation myself | tkinter, colorama |
| üó∫Ô∏è | **[Address Parser](https://github.com/iomyaki/geo-address-parser)** | During an internship as an analyst @ Sovcombank, I wrote a script for parsing geographical addresses (in Russian) with different formatting (for example, to successfully extract the city name after " –≥", "–≥ ", "–≥." and "–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥") | RegEx, pandas, xlwings |
| üß¨ | **[AutoCoEx](https://github.com/iomyaki/auto_coex)** | My bachelor's thesis project, a program for analyzing gene differential co-expression using a denoising autoencoder. The program was written independently, with minimal corrections from my scientific supervisor | CUDA, torch, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib |
